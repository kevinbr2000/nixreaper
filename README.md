(Why r you here.. This NixOS setup is messy anyways..)

Also, this is my second time making a GitHub repository, so please dont cancel me if this repository is messy and bad. 

:(

Update: Ive completely left NixOS due to how it handles .sh files and other stuff. Dont get me wrong, i love how everything is neatly in one config but it just feels like ive been fighting with this OS.
